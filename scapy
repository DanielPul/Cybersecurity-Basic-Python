#Python can be a powerful tool for implementing cybersecurity measures.
#One common approach is to create a script for network monitoring and intrusion detection. 
#Below is an example of a simple Python script using the 'scapy' library 
#to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activity

#Have Fun. 

import logging
from scapy.all import *

# Set logging level to suppress IPv6 warning
logging.getLogger("scapy.runtime").setLevel(logging.ERROR)

def packet_callback(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(IP):
        src_ip = packet[IP].src
        dst_ip = packet[IP].dst

        print(f"[*] Detected packet from {src_ip} to {dst_ip}")

        # Perform checks for suspicious activity
        if packet.haslayer(TCP):
            # Check for TCP SYN packets (potential port scanning)
            if packet[TCP].flags == 2:
                print("[!] SYN packet detected - Potential port scanning!")

        # Add more checks for other types of suspicious activity as needed

# Start sniffing network traffic
print("[*] Starting packet sniffer...")
sniff(prn=packet_callback, store=0)
