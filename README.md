Cybersecurity for Python. 
This script uses the scapy library to capture and analyze network packets. It checks for TCP SYN packets, 
which are commonly used in port scanning activities. You can extend this script to include additional checks for other
types of suspicious activities such as ARP spoofing, DNS tunneling, or unusual traffic patterns.

To run this script, you'll need to install the scapy library if you haven't already:
pip install scapy

Save the script to a file (e.g., network_monitor.py) and run it using Python:
python network_monitor.py

This script provides a basic framework for network monitoring and detection of suspicious activity.
Depending on your specific requirements and environment, you may need to customize and extend it further 
to meet your organization's cybersecurity needs. Additionally, it's important to consider factors such as performance, 
scalability, and integration with existing security infrastructure when implementing cybersecurity solutions.

Thank you,
